Version 0.2.0 (17.11.2019)

- Split first pass from second pass for two-pass encoding and use a different task scheduler for two-pass encodes.
  - Use the first-pass log size as simple metric to estimate
    second-pass runtime and schedule the second passes accordingly.
    Large logs indicate long and/or complex scenes that take long to encode.
  - Start encoding long running scenes first, which will result in better multicore usage at the end of the processing.
  - It avoids starting long scenes, like the credits, at the end of the processs, and therefore lessens the impact of
    a single, long encode delaying the whole process. With this scheduling approach, it is way more likely that the
    last running encodings will be encoding short and easy scenes and therefore having less overall delay.

Version 0.1.3 (17.11.2019)

- Fixed broken Two-pass log file moving.
- Fixed skipping the first pass of two-pass encodes, if that is already finished.
- Always overwrite aborted single-pass or second-pass encodes.


Version 0.1.2 (17.11.2019)

- Gracefully handle missing input files
- Enable @-notation in the argument parser to load arguments from files
- Move first pass encoder logs to the completed temporary directory, so that completed first passes can be skipped.


Version 0.1.1 (16.11.2019)

- Replaced -2/--two-pass with -1/--single-pass. Two-Pass encoding is the new default.
- Per default, use 8 concurrent encodes instead of 2
- Removed tile usage from the default encoder parameters, due to possible frame curruptions
- Removed threading support from the default encoder parameters,
  because multiple encoder instances scale more consistently.


Version 0.1.0 (12.11.2019)

- Initial version.

-Implemented features:
  - Command line interface
  - Transcode Videos to AV1 using libaom-av1
  - Single-Pass and Two-Pass encoding mode (currently defaulting to Single-Pass)
  - Scene cut detection with customizable threshold
  - Scene length control by providing a lower bound to the individual scene length.
    Shorter detected scenes will be merged to improve encoding efficiency
  - Scene-parallel encoding using multiple ffmpeg instances
  - Concurrency control by a configurable upper limit of parallel instances
  - Deinterlacing support using the yadif filter.
  - Passing raw, custom encoder parameters to ffmpeg, both global ffmpeg options and encoder-specific options
  - Resumable encodes: Finished scenes are collected in a specific directory. If the encoding is aborted and
    restarted, already present data is skipped when the encoding process is restarted.
  - Customizable data directories
  - Customizable ffmpeg binary location and name
  - Integration with Cutelog for log display purposes
  - Dumping of parsed scenes for inspection purposes
  - Optional dumping of generated ffmpeg command lines for inspection purposes

- Limitations and missing features:
  - The output video name is automatically generated and currently can’t be changed.
  - The output will always be muxed into a matroska container. Raw stream output or other containers are unsupported.
    Use mkvextract or the muxer of your choice to remux the output video.
  - Due to the output file handling, encoding multiple videos with names differing only in the extension
    (e.g. "video.mp4" and "video.avi") will cause a naming conflict and abort the encoding process
    in the final step, if central data storage is used (with --output-dir or --temp-dir).
    The encoding in this situation should be resumable, if the videos are processed individually.
  - If a central data storage is specified, (with --output-dir or --temp-dir),
    files with the same name but originating from different source directories will collide in the same way
    as in the point above.
  - A maximal scene length cannot be specified. This is planned, but the algorithm for this is not yet designed.
  - No GUI
